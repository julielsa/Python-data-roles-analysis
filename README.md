# Data Roles Analysis using Python

# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, specifically targeting data analyst roles. This project emerged from a desire to better navigate and comprehend the job market. It examines the top-paying and most in-demand skills to identify optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

Using data from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python)  the analysis includes detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I investigate key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)
